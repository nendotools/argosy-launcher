**A gamepad-first Android launcher for retro gaming handhelds with native RomM integration.**

Sync your entire game library from your self-hosted [RomM](https://github.com/rommapp/romm) server, download games and BIOS files on demand, track your achievements, and play across devices with automatic save sync—all from a controller-native interface designed for Anbernic, Retroid Pocket, Odin, and similar devices.

## Feature Highlights

### Native RomM Client
First-class integration with [RomM](https://github.com/rommapp/romm). Sync your entire library with rich metadata from IGDB—cover art, descriptions, genres, franchises, player counts, and more. Your collection, your server, your handheld.

### Automatic Downloads
Download ROMs and BIOS files directly from your RomM server. Games are automatically sorted by platform. Queue multiple downloads and let Argosy handle the rest.

### Save Sync
Continue playing across devices. Bidirectional save sync with your RomM server keeps your progress in sync automatically. Conflict detection ensures you never lose data.

### RetroAchievements
View your earned achievements and track your progress. Argosy displays achievement data synced from your RomM server, showing what you've unlocked and what's left to earn.

### Collections
Organize your library your way. Create custom collections, or use smart collections like "Top Unplayed", "Recently Added", and "Most Played". Pin your favorites to the home screen for quick access.

### Gamepad-First Design
Built for controllers from the ground up. Navigate your entire library, manage downloads, and launch games without ever touching the screen. Full D-pad, analog stick, and button support.

## Customize Your Experience

### Video Wallpaper
Set YouTube video previews as dynamic backgrounds on the home screen. Watch trailers and gameplay footage while browsing your collection.

### Ambient Audio
Add background music to your browsing experience. Select any audio file to play while navigating your library.

### Display Customization
Fine-tune the visual experience:
- **Themes**: Light, dark, or system-matched
- **Backgrounds**: Blur, saturation, and opacity controls for game art backgrounds
- **Box Art Styles**: Adjust grid density, aspect ratio, and visual effects
- **Sound Effects**: Add audio feedback to navigation with built-in presets or custom sounds

## Smart Emulator Management

### Auto-Detection
Argosy automatically detects installed emulators and assigns them to the appropriate platforms. No manual configuration required for most setups.

### RetroArch Core Selection
When using RetroArch, select specific cores per platform. Argosy manages core selection so you launch with the right emulator every time.

### Multi-Disc Games
PlayStation and other multi-disc games are handled automatically. When you launch a multi-disc game, Argosy presents a disc picker so you can choose where to start.

### Supported Emulators
RetroArch, PPSSPP, DuckStation, AetherSX2, Dolphin, DraStic, melonDS, Mupen64Plus FZ, Pizza Boy, Lime3DS, Azahar, Flycast, Redream, and more. Missing your emulator? [Open an issue](https://github.com/nendotools/argosy-launcher/issues).
