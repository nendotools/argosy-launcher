## What is Argosy?

Argosy is a launcher designed for retro gaming handhelds like Anbernic, Retroid Pocket, and Odin devices. It serves as a native Android client for [RomM](https://github.com/rommapp/romm), the self-hosted ROM manager, bringing your entire game library to your handheld with a gamepad-first interface.

## Key Features

### Native RomM Integration
First-class client for RomM self-hosted game library. Sync your entire collection with rich metadata sourced from IGDB, including cover art, descriptions, genres, and more.

### Hassle-Free ROM Management
No manual folder organization required. Games are automatically sorted by platform when downloaded from your RomM server.

### Save Sync
Sync your saves across devices through your RomM server. Supports multiple save slots for managing different playthroughs.

### Library Filtering
Browse your collection by genre, player count, franchise, or region. Find multiplayer games for a session or filter to your favorite series.

### Direct Downloads
Download games from your RomM server directly to your device. Queue multiple downloads and track progress as they complete.

### Smart Emulator Detection
Argosy auto-detects installed emulators and launches the appropriate one for each platform. Supports standalone emulators and RetroArch cores. If your preferred emulator isn't detected, [open an issue](https://github.com/nendotools/argosy-launcher/issues) and we'll add support.

### Gamepad-First Design
Built for controller navigation from the ground up. Browse your library, download games, and launch emulators without touching the screen.

### Image Caching
Cache all images locally for offline browsing. Access your library with full cover art and metadata even without a network connection.

### Steam Games
Index and launch Steam games installed on your device. Supports games installed via GameHub or GameNative.

### App Launcher
Quick access to installed emulators and other apps without leaving the launcher.
